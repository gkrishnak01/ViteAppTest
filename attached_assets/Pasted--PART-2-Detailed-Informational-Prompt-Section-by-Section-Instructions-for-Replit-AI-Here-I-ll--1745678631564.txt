üìÑ PART 2: Detailed Informational Prompt ‚Äî Section-by-Section Instructions for Replit AI
Here, I'll break each portfolio section into detailed prompts you can directly pass to Replit AI or similar tools.
(Every block will specify design, animations, content ideas, styling hints.)

üß© SECTION 1: Hero / Landing Page
Prompt to Replit AI:
"Create a full-screen Hero Section with a dark theme (#0e0e10) background.
Integrate a slow-rotating 3D model of either a satellite, aircraft wing, or composite structure fibers using Three.js or a GLB model.

Place large heading text in the center:

'ARJITH A V' (bold, futuristic font like Orbitron, 80px font size)

Below it: 'Aerospace Engineer | Material Specialist | Sustainable Innovator' (lighter weight)

Below the tagline, place an animated 'View Portfolio' button (hover glow effect, onClick scrolls smoothly to next section).

Add parallax effect with small star fields moving slowly in background using Three.js or simple CSS parallax.

Animate elements with Framer Motion: fade-in text, scale-up on button hover."

üß© SECTION 2: About Me
Prompt to Replit AI:
"Create a clean About Me section with soft fade-in effects.
Include a short biography paragraph about Arjith A V, Aerospace Materials Engineer focused on sustainable innovation.

Build an Animated Timeline (horizontal or vertical) showing:

MSc in Aerospace Materials (University of Sheffield)

BTech in Aerospace Engineering (Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham)

Computer Maths (Chavara Public School)

Beside the timeline, insert small 3D elements floating slowly:

A rotating green globe (symbolizing sustainability)

A stylized aircraft wing (symbolizing aerospace)

Background subtle motion: low-opacity fiber textures (motion blur effect).
Animate timeline cards with slide-in from left/right as user scrolls."

üß© SECTION 3: Experience
Prompt to Replit AI:
"Design an animated Vertical Timeline for professional experiences.

For each experience:

Atomix Materials (Co-Founder)

Brahm√†stra Aerospace (Project Intern)

Use modern icons (Leaf+Lab Flask for Atomix, Rocket for Brahm√†stra).

When the user scrolls down:

Animate icons scaling up when entering viewport.

Expand experience cards with smooth sliding.

Include a tiny animated 3D Rocket that moves upward along the timeline path as the user scrolls."

üß© SECTION 4: Projects and Publications
Prompt to Replit AI:
"Create a Projects section using a Card Grid Layout.

Each project (like 'Collaborative Optimization of Medical Supply Chains') should be shown as a flip card:

Front: Project Name + Icon

Back: Short description + Skills/Technologies used.

Add connecting animated SVG lines between cards (appearing as user scrolls) showing evolution and growth.

Add soft hover zoom effect on cards. Smooth transition between front and back on click/hover."

üß© SECTION 5: Skills and Certifications
Prompt to Replit AI:
"Create an animated Skill Progress Section.

For skills:

Engineering (95%)

Composite Structures (90%)

Data Analysis (85%)

Represent skills with animated progress bars (Framer Motion or custom CSS animations).

Certifications:

Web GIS Technology

Energy Literacy Training

GE Aerospace Simulation

Each Certification shown as a floating badge with soft bounce animation on hover."

üß© SECTION 6: Contact Section
Prompt to Replit AI:
"Create a Contact Section.

Include:

Full Name

Email (arjithav2911@gmail.com)

Mobile Number (+447553689777)

Add an Animated Contact Form:

Name, Email, Message fields

On form submit: Animate a small SVG Paper Plane flying away to indicate success.

Behind the form, add a moving SVG background (stylized plane trail or orbit path).
Keep submit button animated with hover glow and click scaling."

üß© SECTION 7: Footer
Prompt to Replit AI:
"Create a minimalist footer with dark background.

Include:

Animated LinkedIn icon (pulse effect)

Email link (mailto)

Small text: 'Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Arjith A V'

Add light scroll reveal animation for footer elements."

üé® GLOBAL SETTINGS
Prompt to Replit AI:
"Use these Global Styles:

Dark Mode Theme (#0e0e10 background, white text)

Accent Colors: Green (#38b000), Blue (#00b4d8)

Font 1 (Headings): Orbitron or Poppins

Font 2 (Body): Lato or Inter

Responsive Design: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile breakpoints

Smooth Snap Scrolling across all sections

Page transitions using Framer Motion

Lazy Load all 3D assets for performance

Optimize for loading speed and SEO meta tags."
