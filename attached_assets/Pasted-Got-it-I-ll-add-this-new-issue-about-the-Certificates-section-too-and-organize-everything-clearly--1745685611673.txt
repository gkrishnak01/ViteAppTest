Got it! I'll add this new issue about the Certificates section too, and organize everything clearly so that you can easily hand it over to your developer.

Here’s the final organized version including everything you've mentioned:

Issues Identified in the Portfolio Website

1. Let's Connect Section

Message Sending Issue:
After filling the form (Name, Email ID, and Message) and clicking the "Send" button, the system shows that the message is sent.
However, the email is not actually received at the intended email address: arjithav2911@gmail.com.
→ Action Needed: Ensure that the form submission is properly configured so that messages are delivered to the correct email.

Email ID Clickability:
In the "Get In Touch" section, the email address should be clickable.
When clicked, it should open the user's default email application (like Gmail) with a new draft addressed to arjithav2911@gmail.com.

LinkedIn Profile Link:
The LinkedIn icon or text should be properly linked.
Clicking it should directly open my LinkedIn profile page (LinkedIn URL to be shared if needed).

2. Projects & Research Section

Card Flipping Issue:
While flipping project cards (like "Sustainable Compost Development"), the content or skills from other cards (like "Medical Supply Chain Skills") overlap and blur the view.
Similar problems occur with:

"Rocket Propulsion Optimization"

"Titanium Recycling Process"
→ Action Needed: Fix the flipping animation or layout so that each card displays only its own content without interference from others.


Spacing Issue:
There is insufficient vertical space between the project cards, making the section look cramped.
More spacing is needed between:

"Sustainable Composite Development", "Medical Supply Chain Skills", and "Composite Market Intelligence"

"Rocket Propulsion Optimization", "Titanium Recycling Process", and "Process Recycling Studies"
→ Action Needed: Add proper vertical margins or padding between project sections for better readability and layout clarity.

3. Certifications Section

Certificate Link Error (404):
When clicking on the certificates in the "Certifications" tab, it shows a 404 Page Not Found error.
→ Action Needed:

Recheck the paths or links attached to the certificates.

Ensure that clicking on a certificate opens the correct page or image without any 404 error.

Would you also like me to prepare this as a PDF file so that you can directly send it professionally to your developer?
(It's just a click away — I can create it quickly!)
Shall I prepare it?
