Recommendations for LinkedIn Optimization
Banner: Create an animated banner (using Canva) with rockets, composites, and sustainability themes.

Media: Add videos/GIFs of CFD simulations, composite materials, and rocket prototypes to the "Experience" section.

Featured Section: Link to an external portfolio (e.g., Wix/Webflow) showcasing 3D models, pitch decks, and research highlights.

Skills: Use symbols to visualize proficiency (e.g., Composite Structures: â–°â–°â–°â–°â–±).

This structure emphasizes achievements, quantifiable results, and keywords (e.g., sustainable composites, CFD, circular economy) to attract recruiters and align with LinkedInâ€™s algorithm. Let me know if youâ€™d like help drafting specific sections in more detail! ðŸš€
